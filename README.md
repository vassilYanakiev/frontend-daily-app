## Backend Setup

This project requires a backend service to be running. The backend service can be set up using Docker Compose.

   git clone https://github.com/vassilYanakiev/backend-daily-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the backend project directory:

This command starts the backend service in the background.

Please ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine before executing these steps.
